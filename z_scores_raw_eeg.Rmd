Please change the read_feather and write_feather inputs appropriately

```{r}
orig <- 
  arrow::read_feather('sub10_ses1_music.feather')
```

```{r}
# transpose original tibble to create column-wise time series vectors
t_orig <- t(orig)

# scale (calculate z scores; each column of the output will have mean = 0 and sd = 1)
z_t_orig <- scale(t_orig)

# transpose again to get data back to row-wise time series
z_orig <- t(z_t_orig)
```

```{r}
# write feather file
arrow::write_feather(as.data.frame(z_orig),'z_subj10_ses1_music.feather')
```
